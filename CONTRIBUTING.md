**Bug reports**

Bug reports are welcome and should be opened in the github tracker. Bug reports should contain enough information to be reproducible by someone else. This means including the version of bbq and MESA used as well as inlists and input files. These should be trimmed to be as small as possible while still reproducing the bug.


**Pull requests**

PR's for new features are welcome and should be opened in github. They are especially welcome if they expose more of the existing functionality. PRâ€™s should describe the bug they are solving or the new physics they are implementing. They should also include a test case (or modification to an existing test case) to ensure that it is working.

New physics should first be integrated into MESA whenever possible before being added here as an option.
